<p>Light of the world, you stepped down into darkness<br/>
Opened my eyes, let me see<br/>
Beauty that made this heart adore You<br/>
Hope of a life spent with You </p>

<blockquote>
<p>So, here I am to worship<br/>
Here I am to bow down<br/>
Here I am to say that You&#8217;re my God<br/>
You&#8217;re altogether lovely, altogether worthy,<br/>
Altogether wonderful to me </p>
</blockquote>

<p>King of all days, oh so highly exalted,<br/>
Glorious in heaven above<br/>
Humbly you came to the Earth You created<br/>
All for love&#8217;s sake became poor </p>

<p>And I&#8217;ll never know<br/>
How much it cost<br/>
To see my sin upon the cross (X3)</p>

<h1 id="everybodyoughttoknow">Everybody Ought To Know</h1>

<p>Everybody ought to know (echo) (X3)<br/>
Who Jesus is (echo) </p>

<blockquote>
<p>He&#8217;s the &#8220;Lily of the Valley&#8221; (echo)<br/>
He&#8217;s the Bright and Morning Star (echo)<br/>
He&#8217;s the Fairest of Ten Thousand (echo)<br/>
Everybody ought to know (echo)</p>

<h1 id="turnyoureyes">Turn Your Eyes</h1>

<p>Turn your eyes upon Jesus<br/>
Look full in His wonderful face<br/>
And the things of earth will grow strangely dim<br/>
In the light of His glory and grace </p></body></html>
