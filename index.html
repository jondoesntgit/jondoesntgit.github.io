    	<h3>Let There be Light!
    	</h3>
    	<p>
    	Have you ever worked furiously towards a goal only to realize when you were done that you achieved something different than you set out to?
    	What is more important: knowing what direction you're pointed, or getting there fast?
    	</p>

    	<p>I study how light can be used for inertial navigation of aircraft. My research at Stanford's <a href="https://ginzton.stanford.edu/">Ginzton Laboratory</a> seeks to make <a href="https://www.osapublishing.org/ao/abstract.cfm?uri=ao-15-5-1099">fiber optic gyroscopes</a> more accurate and less expensive.
    	</p>

    	<p>
    	Moreover, I research how the <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/8-12.htm">light of the world</a> can be used for the navigation of the challenges of this life, and a roadmap to the life to come. I seek to <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/5-16.htm">share this light</a> with others.
