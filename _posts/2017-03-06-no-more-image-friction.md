meta_description: I'm tired of finding images. It keeps me from writing!
---

I get it. Images are nice to look at. But the problem is that I'm not a full time blogger. I'm a full time student. When blogging is your side hustle and there are no due dates, it's easy to find excuses to procstinate. That's why I'm no longer putting images on this blog (mostly).

In the history of the blog, the biggest hold up has always been finding and formatting a nice cover photo for each entry. While it makes for nice eye candy when shared on social media sites, it adds a lot of mental resistance when publishing a new article.

I attempted to resolve this issue once before. In September, I used two of my favorite apps, [Editorial](omz-software.com/editorial/) and [Workflow](https://workflow.is/), to make an epic workflow where I could press one button, and my phone would open the camera, take a picture, format and compress it, upload it to Imgur, copy the link, and then paste it into the YAML frontmatter in each post.

That worked great except it was still an extra step!

So today I'm declaring my independence.

> When in the Course of human events it becomes necessary for one person to dissolve the bands of convention which have connected him with an obligation to include images on each post, a decent respect to the opinions of bloggerkind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to separation.

> I hold this truth to be self-evident, that all blogs should be created equal, and without discrimination of graphical availability. But when a long train of abuses reduce these articles absolute obscurity, it is the authors right, it is the authors duty, to throw off such convention, and to provide new gaurds for the article's future security. Such has been the patient sufference of this author, and such is now the necessity which constrains him to alter the former systems of blogging.

> I therefore, as the author of this blog, do, in the name and authority of the thoughts and reflections that have not been published, solemnly publish and declare, that this blog shall be absolved from the allegiance to banner images and eye candy.
