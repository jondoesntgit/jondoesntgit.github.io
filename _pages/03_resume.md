## Work Experience

##### Research Assistant
*September 2016 - Present*, Stanford CA  
Department of Applied Physics.

Conducted research in developing and demonstrating a new type of laser-driven  ber optic gyroscope.

##### Student Dean and Resident Assistant

*August 2012 - May 2016*, Berrien Springs, MI

In addition to my role as a student dean and RA, I created scripts for automating processes such as correspondence doucmentation, name tags, leave documentation, and  re rosters.

##### Summer Camp Boys Counselor

*Summers, 2013 - 2016*, Oxford, WI

Counseled boys age 7 – 17. Assisted in teaching classes in unicycling and music. In addition to these responsibilities, I used a bluetooth chip to trigger an Arduino for pyrotechnic effects for a play, and helped repair damaged Nitro RC Cars in my time off.

##### Departmental Worker

*September 2011 - May 2016*, Berrien Springs, MI

Worked in Physics, Math, and Honors Departments while at Andrews University. In addition to my roles as a grader, tutor, and lab supervisor, I worked as part of LIGO collaboration. Created scripts for querying and fetching gravitational wave candidate events from online database, and ran scripts to do signal processing on Caltech computing clusters. Later work involved collaboration with LIGO group at University of Birmingham, UK in development and testing of educational and public outreach software, speci cally games for use in high schools and science fairs.

 I also designed a web application for uploading barcode data from scanning students at weekly colloquiums and general physics labs. The web application allowed students to see up-to-date attendance records, and allowed instructors to generate class reports.

##### Math Teacher

*September 2013 - May 2014*, Beirut, Lebanon

Taught math in 7th and 8th grade classrooms as part of school’s international track program. I additionally sponsored a robotics club and assisted in ITS and course scheduling software.

##### Research Assistant

*June 2012 - Aug 2012*, Canberra, Australia

Characterized an Orbits Lightwave, Inc. Lorentzian Bragg Grating Filter, most importantly for the purpose of proving or disproving the manufacturer’s claim that the product was thermally independent. Assessed uses of the  lter in PDH feedback loops.
