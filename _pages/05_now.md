- This summer, I'm taking a break from classes at Stanford and focusing myself on getting research done on Fiber Optic Gyroscopes.
- I'm also working on getting my new company [SimpleDoesIt](http://simpledoesit.com) up and running! If you know anybody who needs a website built, refer them to [SimpleDoesIt](http://simpledoesit.com).
- Mateja and I recently moved, and are getting settled into our new apartment!
- We're almost out of debt. By September we will have paid off $34k of student loans in just 10 months!
