# Driving to Us 
 
We assume you know how to get to Stanford University. If you are entering Stanford from the north or east, you are likely going to be routed through either 
Galvez street, Palm Drive, or Serra Street. In any of these cases, you want to find Campus Circle Drive and drive clockwise around it. We live in  
a four-story building called Studio 2 on the corner of Escondido Rd and Campus Drive. Please note the parking instructions below. 
 
## Parking 
 
Parking in residential parking requires a pass which I can purchase from the transportation office for ~$5  
per day (a day counts as the day that it is used until the following morning at 12:00 pm). 
 
If you are visiting in the evening after 4:00 PM, or over a weekend (Friday 4:00 pm until Monday 8:00 am) you can park for free 
in the Graduate School of Business parking garage. 
 
655 Knight Way, Stanford, CA 94305 
 
From here, you simply walk clockwise around campus drive until you see a roundabout. We are on the corner of Escondido Rd and  
Campus Drive. It is about a 5 minute walk. 
 
# Entering our building 
 
The easiest way to enter our building is from the stairwell on the south side (the side closest to the roundabout). We are on the 
third floor, and you can text us when you arrive, and we will let you in. 
 
You can also use the Door King module on the main entrance to dial our extension. This will ring our number and we can buzz you in. 
Take the elevator to the third floor. We are apartment 326.
