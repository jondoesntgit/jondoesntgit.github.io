Hi, I am Jonathan Wheeler. I consider myself a polyglot, a software engineer,
and a friend. I'm not trying to change the world. That's too cliche, and
I'm not sure that changing the world for the sake of changing the world is what
we should be after. **My mission is to equip others to help care for the world.**

Each of us has 24 hours per day allotted to us. We use this time to perform tasks
which improve our lives, the lives around us. We are happiest when we balance between
working, and enjoying the fruits of our labor. This is so because it is the model that
our Creator set up for us when we were created.

> The LORD God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to work it and take care of it.  
-- Genesis 2:15

Therefore, labor towards caring for the earth and its inhabitants is fulfillment of our
God-given identity and purpose, and is a form of worship.

Our individual and corporate identities are further encoded into each of our personal 
narratives in the form of language.
The most common means of recording and accessing these narratives is in the form of text.
We see this happening in

- biblical accounts
- biographies/ancient texts
- journals, diaries
- documents and certificates

One of my main goals is finding ways to be a better steward of the life God has given me by
spending His time wisely, doing tasks that care for His creation (which includes people), and documenting my
life experience and learning from the lives of others. I use what I learn to create tools
and to educate others on how they can care for the world we live in, for God's glory.
